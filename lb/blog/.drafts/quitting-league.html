I started playing League when Zed was released, the Winter of 2012. It has been 9 years. There was a long hiatus from playing league in between the years 2016 to 2020, with ons and offs in between. But I recently just started playing again regularly this year. Looking back it is probably the most influencial game I have played, next to probably MapleStory and maybe Gunz. Why does League have such staying power compared to other games for me? And why is it so hard for me to quit? Even with 4 years of being technically "cold-turkey", why it is still so easy for me come back and play regularly? I'm trying to understand it and also as an activity to do to replace league for the moment. The day of writting is May 22, 2021.

Here are few reasons I think it is hard for me to quit league:
<ul>
    <li>The social aspect, I have friends who play and it is how we hang out</li>
    <li>A habitual thing, playing League becomes the default of how I pass time</li>
    <li>The sense of achivement, the hit of dopamine, when you outplay an opponent</li>
    <li>A sense of progress, the levels, honor level, rankings</li>
    <li>The lootbox mechanics, getting random stuff feels good</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Social Aspect</h2>
<p>
I think one reason League is so hard for many to quit is because many people are playing it. League is a twelve year old game, and it is still widely succesful. Though it's followings have dwindled it is still a pretty big game considering its age. Many of my friends still plays League and the feeling of missing out does definitly play a part in it's keeping power. But it could be a positive feedback loop, the addictive nature of the game, keeps many people playing, and then the social aspect adds to the addtivness of the game.

<h2>A non-gamer's Perspective</h2>
<p> Here I welcome a guest writer, she is a non-gamer and she will express her thoughts about video games</h2>
<p>So I only have a minute to write this. I have personally just played this game once. My experience of this game is that why does my boyfriend likes that over me:( I don't understand why there are so many of them and they does the same thing! But on the plus side, I do like the minions and the animals around the field, they are so dang cute!! I feel like every gamer needs to take time to feed them you know, they are important characters for non-gamers like me:) So yeah, sorry I wasted your time reading this, but if you have a girlfriend, don't play this game all the time, spend some time with her, because she is the final boss;) you're welcome.
