I started playing League when Zed was released, the Winter of 2012. It has been 9 years. There was a long hiatus from playing league in between the years 2016 to 2020, with ons and offs in between. But I recently just started playing again regularly this year. Looking back it is probably the most influencial game I have played, next to probably MapleStory and maybe Gunz. Why does League have such staying power compared to other games for me? And why is it so hard for me to quit? Even with 4 years of being technically "cold-turkey", why it is still so easy for me come back and play regularly? I write this trying to understand it and also as an activity to do to replace league for the moment. Today is May 22, 2021.

Here are few reasons I think it is hard for me to quit league:
<ul>
    <li>The social aspect, I have friends who play and it is how we hang out</li>
    <li>A habitual thing, playing League becomes the default of how I pass time</li>
    <li>The sense of achivement, the hit of dopamine, when you outplay an opponent</li>
    <li>A sense of progress, the levels, honor level, rankings</li>
    <li>The lootbox mechanics, getting random
</ul>
