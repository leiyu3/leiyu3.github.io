This post came out of a conversation I had with someone during the December of
2019 at Ryerson University. It was Wednesday and the Christian Fellowship I was
attending was doing evangelism. I introduced myself and asked if she
knew Christ. She said that she's not religious but her parents used to be
Catholic. Seeing that she might be familiar with some Christian concepts I was
a bit relieved and asked her why she isn't Catholic like her parents. And oh
boy, I was hit by few questions that I was not ready to answer well in the
perspective of a non-believer. This blog post is an attempt to answer the
questions and challenges she posed to the Christian faith. I will try my best
to develop the arguments. I might not be able to talk to her again and she
most likely will not be able to see this blog post. But I will at least be ready if anyone else comes along and asks the same questions.
</p>

<p>
I will try my best to recollect and restate her questions and challenges:
1)There is very obvious contradictions in the bible. One example was, "Why
would a God who commended to not kill, allowed the Israelites to kill thousands
of Canaanites during the conquest (and many other places in the bible)?". 2)
How come God punishes sinner in the present through death when sinner will
eventually suffer eternally already in hell? Why not let sinners live how they
want right now since it's guaranteed that they will be punished? If sinners are
punished by death then God isn't giving them a chance to repent and to love
Him. 3) A God that only loves you back when you love Him back isn't a loving
God at all. He is a tyrant. 4) On following a God while there is still many
mysteries and questions that we do not yet understand. The following sections
will try to answer these questions.

<h3>Are there Contradictions in the Bible?</h3>


<p>
The seemingly contradiction found in the Bible that was brought to attention
was with the sixth commandment of the Ten Commandments. <q>You shall not
murder.</q> (Exodus 20:13 ESV), to the many different accounts of God
commanding the Israelites to kill in war, genocide in the conquest of the
promised lang of Cannan, and the times when God smitted people in an instant
they have commited a sin.

The flood (Gen 6-8), Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen 18-19), Egyptian firstborns(Exodux 11-12), The Canaanites under Moses and Joshua (Number 21:2-3; Deut. 20:17, Joshua 6:17,21), the Amalekites under Saul (1 Samuel 15),

Old Testmaent Mass Killings

How can a God who commands that murder is wrong then continues to command the Israelites to commit mass killing? Even more, how can a good God even command genocide and kill Himself?

<h3>Why does God punish people in the present age when they will be punished again in Hell?</h3>

<h3>Is God a dictator and is He loving?</h3>

<h3>How can we trust in a God that does not tell us everything that He is doing?</h3>
