        <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently dual booting Arch Linux and Windows.
        Arch Linux being my daily driver while Windows is there for the occasional
        gaming with friends and softwares that are only available for windows
        (such as SolidWorks). I like the customizability of Arch Linux especially the
        option of using a tiling window manager so that my work flow can be keyboard centric.
        As well as how minimal it is to run(Arch Linux never made my laptop as hot as it is on Windows).
        </p>

        <h3>Laptop</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently using a Thinkpad T470.
        It is my first Thinkpad and I really like the design philosophy of the older Thinkpads of allowing users to repair and upgrade their laptop.
        It has helped me to get into tinkering with hardware as I was able to repair the LCD cable when it broke.
        I have also installed an extra SSD through the WLAN slot that was vacant in my model. Giving me a total of 1TB of SSD storage.
        This allowed me to dual boot Windows and Linux without the usual headaches of Windows messing up the Linux install.
        The Windows licence that comes on the motherboard has also helped a lot when reinstalling Windows in the past.
        </p>

        <h3>Text Editor</h3>
        <p>
        My text editor of choice is NeoVim. I like to do everything on the keyboard if possible. Since it allows me to everything
        fast and efficient without the need to carry a mouse. There are some plugins that I use but I will list them later....
