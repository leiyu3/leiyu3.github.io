        <h3>Operating System</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently dual booting Arch Linux and Windows.  Arch Linux being
        my daily driver while Windows is there for the occasional gaming with
        friends and softwares that are only available for windows (such as
        SolidWorks). I like the customizability of Arch Linux especially the
        option of using a tiling window manager so that my work flow can be
        keyboard centric.  As well as how minimal it is to run(Arch Linux never
        made my laptop as hot as it is on Windows).
        </p>

        <h3>Laptop</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently using a Thinkpad T470.  It is my first Thinkpad and I
        really like the design philosophy of the older Thinkpads of allowing
        users to repair and upgrade their laptop.  It has helped me to get into
        tinkering with hardware as I was able to repair the LCD cable when it
        broke.  I have also installed an extra SSD through the WLAN slot that
        was vacant in my model. Giving me a total of 1TB of SSD storage.  This
        allowed me to dual boot Windows and Linux without the usual headaches
        of Windows messing up the Linux install.  The Windows licence that
        comes on the motherboard has also helped a lot when reinstalling
        Windows in the past.
        </p>

        <h3>Text Editor</h3>
        <p>
        My text editor of choice is NeoVim. I like to do everything on the
        keyboard if possible. Since it allows me to everything fast and
        efficient without the need to carry a mouse. There are some plugins
        that I use but I will list them later....
        </p>


        <h3>Word Processor</h3>
        <p>
        I use LaTex for most of my work. I like that is very robust while being
        very fast, and that the tex file is stored as text so that I never have
        to worry about not having a compatible software to be able to view my
        files. I prefer it over Google Drive or Word because it handles a lot
        of the small stuff such as caption and formatting on its own, so I do
        not have to spend time formatting and can just work on the actuall
        writing.
        </p>

        <h3>CAD Software</h3>
        <p>
        My 3D CAD model software of choice is OnShape. I prefer it over
        SolidWorks because it is free aswell and it runs in the browser.
        Think of it like Google Doc of word processing for 3D CAD softwares.
        I have also made several of my own 3D model for 3D printing.
        You can check them out <a href="3dprinting.html">here</a>.
