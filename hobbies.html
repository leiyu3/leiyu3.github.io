        <h3>3D Printing</h3>
        <p>I do 3D printing on my free time. I have made several 3D models on my
        own to make designs that improve or solves problems that I have.
        The 3D printer that I have is the Ender 3 Pro by Creality that have been
        further upgraded by myself. The slicer software that I use is Cura by
        Ultimaker.
        For more information go to my <a href="3dprinting.html">3D printing page</a>(not up yet).</p>

        <h3>Paracording</h3>
        <p>A new hobbies that I took on when I graduated.
        I was first interested in it because of this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDLZmyDEOQ">video</a> by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCprDa_LLciUHLoxtoJzPsbg">The Weavers of Eternity Paracord</a>
        So I thought I should make it because it looks pretty cool
        and have some practical values to it aswell as I like to work with my hands.
        I also made some paracord bracelets
        with the paracord that my friend got me. <!-- insert photo of paracord things--></p>
