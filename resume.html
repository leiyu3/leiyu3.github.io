                <p>Designed a mobile robot using the Arduino Uno R3. With
                limited electronic components and common house hold items for
                the mechanical components the robot is able to complete three
                tasks. In the first task the robot is to be manually controlled
                to complete a course. In the second task the robot is to
                complete the course autonomously. In the third task the robot
                is to be able to complete a course while avoiding obstacles.
                The designed robot is able to complete all the task in the
                following times 7 seconds, 4 seconds, and 8 seconds,
                respectively. Did basic wiring and soldering on electronic
                components. Using USART to debug program. Writing of techinical
                report to document the design process and decisions. Videos are
                shown <a

                    Designed a Solar Tracker using the Arduino Uno R3. The Solar Tracker is
                    able to track light in the azimuth and altitude with only two LDR sensors,
                    as well as one stepper motor and servo motor. The mechanical components of
                    the project is made using common house hold items(cardboards, tape, and
                    glue). Did basic wiring and soldering on electronic components. Use of
                    USART to debug program. Writing of technical report to document the design
                    process, and results. Demonstration can be seen <a
